## description
```
Great news! Luciafer has been spotted at an internet cafe! She's using her laptop right now! We can catch her, if we act quickly.

We need your help. Can you figure out a way to remotely connect to her machine and capture the flag?

Her username on her system is luciafer, and her hostname is:
batescafe.deadface.io
```

## walkthrough

start with a basic nmap scan
```
$ nmap batescafe.deadface.io -Pn
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-16 15:31 MDT
Nmap scan report for batescafe.deadface.io (164.90.158.159)
Host is up (0.12s latency).
Not shown: 995 filtered ports
PORT      STATE  SERVICE

50000/tcp closed ibm-db2
50001/tcp closed unknown
50002/tcp closed iiimsf
50003/tcp closed unknown
```

not sure why we're seeing closed ports, but ok.

trying udp
```
$ nc -v -u 164.90.158.159 1-65535
Connection to 164.90.158.159 1 port [udp/*] succeeded!

```

```
$ ssh 164.90.158.159 -l luciiafer
luciiafer@164.90.158.159: Permission denied (publickey).
```

didn't we see a private key somewhere in the pcap?
we did, it is [id_rsa](id_rsa)

```
$ ssh -l luciafer 164.90.158.159 -i id_rsa
