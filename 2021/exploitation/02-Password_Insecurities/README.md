# [02 - Password_Insecurities](https://deadface.ctfd.io/challenges#Password%20Insecurities-26)

## description
```
It looks like DEADFACE is going after the password of one of De Monne's customers: Haily Poutress. She has since changed her password, but De Monne is looking for ways to improve password requirements. De Monne would like you to crack the password from the database leak to determine if Haily's password was secure enough. Submit the flag as flag{password}.
```
