The Ghost Town user d34th, DEADFACE's leader, mentioned setting up a cryptocurrency wallet where funds would be sent to purchase the compromised De Monne data. Find d34th's Twitter account and figure out what the wallet's password is.

Submit the flag as flag{password}.

## walkthrough

from `d34th`:

```
Btw I setup a MEW for receiving funds for this data. Figure we sell it on the dark web to the highest bidder and see how much we can get. I only want our folks having access to the wallet. If you look at my Twitter I’ve got the MEW password there. If you can’t figure out, good, you’re not meant to have access lol
```

on his [page](https://ghosttown.deadface.io/u/d34th/summary), see [this post](https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/show-me-your-desks/57/6), which i'm guessing has an image which shows his twitter account.

but [this](https://cyberhacktics.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/DEADFACECTF2021/images/2021-08-01%2020_06_37-desk-pics.png) doesn't really show us anything

searching twitter, got to [this](https://twitter.com/CHacktics/status/1409307234509676546), which "Introducing d34th, the ringleader of DEADFACE #deadfacectf", with 1 retweet and 8 likes, but none of them seem relevant.
