## description
```
Luciafer is being watched! Someone on the inside of Lytton Labs can see what she is doing and is sending her a message.

One of them says: "Stay away from Lytton Labs... you have been warned."

To find the flag, find the message. You'll know it when you see it. Submit the flag as flag{flag-goes-here}.

Use the PCAP from LYTTON LABS 01 - Monstrum ex Machina.
