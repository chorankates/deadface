# [05 - An_Encrypted_By_Any_Other_Name](https://deadface.ctfd.io/challenges#A(n)%20[ENCRYPTED]%20by%20Any%20Other%20Name-2)

## description
```
An encrypted message from spookyboi has been intercepted by law enforcement, but it is encrypted with an unknown algorithm and an unknown password. We know that he likes to speak in riddles, so perhaps he gave a riddle to one of his cohorts so they would know how to decrypt the message. Discover the algorithm and password, then decrypt the message below. Enter the flag as flag{this-is-the-flag}.

(Hint: We know that the message is encrypted with Electronic Code Book [ECB] cipher block mode, and we know that the password is in lower case.)
