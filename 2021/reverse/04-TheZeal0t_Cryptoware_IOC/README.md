# [04 - TheZeal0t_Cryptoware_IOC](https://deadface.ctfd.io/challenges#TheZeal0t's%20Cryptoware%20IOC%201-60)

## description
```
The Zeal0t's cryptoware has a particular network signature that can be used as an "Indicator of Compromise" (IOC). This indicator is unique to the cryptoware, so it can be used to indicate that a system has been infected by the cryptoware, or the cryptoware attempted to infect it.

Enter the IOC as the flag: Example flag{EXACT-IOC-STRING}
