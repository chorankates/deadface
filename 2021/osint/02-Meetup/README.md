# [02 - Meetup](https://deadface.ctfd.io/challenges#Meetup-64)

## description
```
A member of DEADFACE suggested that they all meet up at some point. With this information, we'd be able to contact law enforcement to get them all at once! What does the picture say about their meetup location, though?

Submit the flag as: flag{location}.

Example: flag{Golden Gate Bridge}.
